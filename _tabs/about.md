My name is Sai kumar Murali krishnan, and I'm a second year applied data science student at Monash University. I've been programming for over 5 years in a variety of languages, from Python to Rust and so on. I have an interest data science visualizations which you can find in some of my writeups. I also enjoy reverse engineering and cybersecurity challenges in the form of CTFs, which I've taken part in.
